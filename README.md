# MALWARE ANALYSIS LAB

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Requirements

- Hypervisor - Vmware, Virtualbox or Hyper-V (Will be using VMware for this demonstration).
- Operating Sysytem - Windows 10 x64 (Installed on your hypervisor)
- Memory - Minimum 80gig
- Installed memory - 2gig ram Minimum
- System type - 64-bit Operating System
- FLARE VM - Windows malware analysis distribution with all the tools we need for malware analysis.

### Security Guidlines

- When executing malware ensure your network configuration is set to host-only
- Do not plug any usb devices in to the VM
- Make sure you download compressed and password protected samples to avoid accidental execution.
- Keep Hypervisor updated
- Do not store any valuable data on your analysis VM
- Disable shared folders, before executing or analizing
- Take snapshots before executing any sample
